# Simple blog renderer
I wanted a wordpress on my linux server, but without javascript. So I wrote simple script, that render my short posts.

No cookies, no sessions and conventional database, with tags, custom pages and hiding articles. Managed via SSH (admin panel is primitive and unsecured).<br><br>
But first:<br>
1) run setup.sh (setup.bat on windows)
2) edit files indicated by the setup script
3) copy /blog/skins/default and create your own.<br><br>
with my skin looks like this:<br>
